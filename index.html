                    Some things are not meant to be said in a message<br>
                    Some things are not loud… but they're still true<br>
                    Some stories aren’t meant to be told in noise…
                    They bloom best in silence in spaces where the heart listens<br><br>
                    This isn’t a story about the past<br>
                    What you’re about to see isn’t just a message<br>
                    It’s a doorway gently opened…
                    Into a part of my heart that still carries warmth,
                    And a little hope, softly folded in every word
                </p>
                <button class="continue-btn" id="nextIntroPart">Next</button>

                    It’s about what still echoes quietly and patiently. This isn’t here to change the past,
                    It’s here to honor it.
                    To understand what was, and maybe…
                    feel what still quietly lingers beneath<br><br>
                    So take a breath,
                    read slowly not with your mind, but with your heart and soul<br><br>
                    For past some days, I’ve made something for you…<br>
                    Let me present it.<br><br>
                    (Keep volume up and let the music speak)
